Title: Dual State Framework
Technologies: C/C++/OpenMP
Description:  This is a framework for making games easier to parallelize. It uses the “Active Objects” paradigm and also two copies of state to allow for non-blocking deterministic parallelism. A simple game will be written to test out the framework.
