As the quantity of todayâ€™s most modern Multi-\/core processors \cite{multiple-corearchitectures} increase, the parallel computing becomes a very important computer technology. ~\newline
~\newline
For this project, a library is created to implements parallel programming mode. The main purpose of the library is to make up a solution for the disadvantage of locker in multiple threads programming. With this library, users can easily code programs implementing parallelism without knowledges of parallel programming mode, so that they have more time to focus on they main work. ~\newline

A benchmark program is designed for profiling the library. It allows users using costumed settings to run the program.
