S\+C\+R\+U\+M agile development methodology will be used for the implementation phase of the project. It is a great way to keep focused on the individual tasks that need to be completed in order make the project a success. Due to short sprints and constant feedback, it becomes easier to cope with the changes. Changes to be made to the project will not be a big impact on the time schedule for the project. ~\newline
~\newline
The duration for the development of the project will be broken down into sprints. The length of sprint for this project will be one week. In each sprint, a set amounts of task are expected to be completed. At the end of each sprint, how far the goal achieved, and how many issues met will be demonstrated to supervisor. \hypertarget{_project_plan_ProjectPlanDocuments}{}\section{Documents}\label{_project_plan_ProjectPlanDocuments}
The following documents will be done during the time scope\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Vision Documentation
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It estimates the value and the risk of the project.
\item It defines the stakeholders and users.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Functional Specification
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It describes functionalities needed by the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Design Documentation
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It shows the design for implementing functionalities that Functional Specification defined.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Research Documentation
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It shows technologies obtained by doing the project.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Technical Manual
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It demostrates how to use the framework.
