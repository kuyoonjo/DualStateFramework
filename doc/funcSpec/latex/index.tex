The main purpose of my project is to create a C++ framework for parallel computing. Parallel computing is the science and art of programming computers that can do more than one operation at once during the same cycle, simultaneously and concurrently. It performs often via having more than one processor.~\newline
 Next, A benchmark program is required for profiling this framework. The program will be designed as a G\+U\+I application which shows the performance in the following list of deferences. -\/\+Number of threads -\/\+Number of objects
