The framework will run on multiple platforms. Source code will be able to be compiled on varies of C++ compilers. In addition, installers for different operating system will be created. Popular I\+D\+E and O\+S will be supported.

User does not need to know the code behind the scene because that is not important. User who has experienced on C++ should be easy to understand the framework. An A\+P\+I document should be created. The document should contain\+: Installation

The framework should run correctly after installation. Memory leaks should not occur at runtime. Deadlock or livelock is not allowed. A deadlock is where a system locks up because two or more processed are waiting for each other to finish. Livelock is similar to deadlock, but except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another. ~\newline
To know more about memory leak, deadlock and livelock requires a high level of programming skill that scriptures cannot be assumed to have. The model allows the user do not need to worry about these issues.\hypertarget{_f_u_r_p_s_FURPSPerformance}{}\section{Performance}\label{_f_u_r_p_s_FURPSPerformance}
The best performance of this framework should be based on the running machine. For example, the C\+P\+U of my laptop is intel i5, which has two cores and executes four threads. The best performance of my laptop is when I use this framework with four threads.~\newline
The framework should not consume too much resources(\+C\+P\+U, R\+A\+M).\hypertarget{_f_u_r_p_s_FURPSSupportability}{}\section{Supportability}\label{_f_u_r_p_s_FURPSSupportability}
Ensure that the product can be localized later for different languages and units later on. The maintenance of the system shall be done as per the maintenance contract. Update will be display when it is available.
