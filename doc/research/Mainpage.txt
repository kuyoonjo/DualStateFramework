\section ParallelProgrammingModelSerialComputingvsParallelComputing Serial Computing vs Parallel Computing
| Serial Computing | Parallel Computing |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
| A problem is broken into a discrete series of instructions | A problem is broken into discrete parts that can be solved concurrently |
| Instructions are executed sequentially one after another | Each part is further broken down to a series of instructions |
| Executed on a single processor | Instructions from each part execute simultaneously on different processors |
| Only one instruction may execute at any moment in time | An overall control/coordination mechanism is employed |

\section ParallelProgrammingModelOpenMP OpenMP
The Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) is a library that can be used to specify shared memory parallelism in Fortran and C/C++ programs. It provides a model for parallel programming that is portable across shared memory architectures from different vendors. The benefit of OpenMP is it is very easy. OpenMP is compiler directive based that means to use OpenMP you need a openMP supported Compiler.More information about the OpenMP API can be found at http://www.openmp.org. 

\section ParallelProgrammingModelIntelTBB Intel TBB
Intel Threading Building Blocks (Intel TBB) is a C and C++ library for creating high performance and scalable parallel applications. It provides a set of interfaces, functions, and renders for implementing parallelism. The advantage of Intel TBB is it is not compiler directive based as OpenMP that means you can use whatever compiler you preferred.

\section ParallelProgrammingModelConcurrencyModel Concurrency Model
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. \n\n
Concurrency vs Parallelism [\ref r4 "4"]
| Concurrency | Parallelism |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Concurrency is when two tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. Eg. multitasking on a single-core machine. | Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time. Eg. on a multicore processor. |
| Eg. multitasking on a single-core machine. | Eg. on a multicore processor. |
| A condition that exists when at least two threads are making progress. A more generalized form of parallelism that can include time-slicing as a form of virtual parallelism. | A condition that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously. |
\n\n
Example Concurrency Models:
	- Actors Model
	- CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)
	- Disruptor
	- Thread

Software packaging is the process used to put a software product into an installation package so that it can be installed by the users of the product on their computers. 
\section SoftwarePackagingOSXPackages OS X Packages
In Mac OS X world, the installer packages have the file extension .pkg. Instead of distributing multiple files for a package, this allowed all of the software files to be contained in a single file for easier distribution with the benefit of package signing. 
\n\n
PackageMaker is part of the Xcode developer software suite. It provides a comfortable graphical user interface to help users create pkg installer easily. [\ref r5 "5"]
