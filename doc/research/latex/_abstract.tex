This report was commissioned to investigate the possibility of developing the library Dual State Framework that helps programmers implement parallel computing easily. The research covers\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item programming languages
\item libraries for Graphics
\item libraries of parallel programming
\item integrated development environments
\item source control tools
\item documentation tools
\item software packaging tools
\end{DoxyItemize}

According to the investigation, I think it is not hard to complete the project. The correct combination of Open Source and free applications seems to be the best choice to develop the framework.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++
\item S\+F\+M\+L
\item Intel T\+B\+B
\item Xcode
\item Git
\item Doxygen, Graphviz, and La\+Tex
\item Package\+Maker, Installforge, Debreate
